# Guessing-game
Assembly Project
Project Idea:
The project is a simple game between two players. The first player writes a secret number, and the second player attempts to guess it. After each guess, a message will appear indicating whether the guess was correct or incorrect.

If the guess is correct, a message will be displayed confirming the correct guess, showing both the user's number and the friend's guess.
If the guess is incorrect, a message will indicate the guess was wrong and display both the user's number and the friend's guess.
This project aims to facilitate interaction between users through a simple guessing game based on correct or incorrect guesses.
